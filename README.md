## 🧠 What I learned

During this project, I gained hands-on experience with several essential front-end development skills:

- 🏗️ **Structuring HTML**  
  Learned to build a clean, semantic HTML page for better accessibility and clarity.

  Mastered CSS Flexbox to perfectly center content both vertically and horizontally.

  Integrated Google Fonts and applied them in CSS for a polished, modern look.

- 🎨 **Component Styling**  
  Practiced styling with border-radius, padding, gap, and background colors to closely match a given design.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  Made the component look great on all devices by using relative units and considering different screen sizes.

- 📁 **Project Organization**  
  Organized files (HTML, CSS, images) and maintained a tidy repository with a proper `.gitignore`.

- 📝 **Following a Style Guide**  
  Translated design specs—colors, typography, spacing—into accurate, maintainable code.

- 🖼️ **Accessible Images**  
  Used descriptive alt text for images to improve accessibility for all users.
